Write C++ code using objects, not functions, to implement the following requirements:

- The program will prioritize emails for a busy company CEO.
- You will use a MaxHeap as a means of implementing a priority queue. A
  priority queue is a queue where emails can shift towards the front of the
  queue based on a priority status.
- You must implement a MaxHeap using a list-based implementation. Then use
  that MaxHeap to handle all your email prioritizing for the CEO.
- You must create objects from scratch. Do not include pre-existing heap
  modules.

Test File format:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `EMAIL <sender category>,<subject line>,<date>` | The emails in the CEO's Inbox should be placed in queue based on their sender category and date. The sender categories and priority to be read are as follows: Boss – read first, Subordinate – read next, Peer – read next, ImportantPerson – read next, OtherPerson – read last. If there is more than one from a sender, then the newest email (not the oldest) should be read first. I discovered this trick while a manager at Sprint. EMAIL is followed by space. The rest of the fields are delimited. Assume `<sender category>` is one of the five strings listed above. Assume `<subject line>` is a string which may contain spaces, but not commas. Assume `<date>` is in the format: MM-DD-YYYY |
| `NEXT` | Next email for the CEO to read. Display the information on the terminal in the following format: Sender: / Subject: / Date: |
| `READ` | CEO has read email and dealt with it |
| `COUNT` | Display current count of unread emails |

The grader will test your code with a different test file. The test file will
begin with the emails in the CEOs Inbox, followed by the commands the CEO
will use to read her Inbox. You can assume a given command will be formatted
as shown, but the order and number of commands may vary. For example, be
able to handle a file that does NEXT or READ when there are no emails, two
NEXTs in a row without an intervening READ (output should be the same for
both NEXTs), two READs in a row without an intervening NEXT (highest
priority email deleted from queue without displaying it).

Sample Test File:

EMAIL Peer,Can you help me on this?,12-01-2024
EMAIL OtherPerson,Try our product,12-19-2024
EMAIL Boss,Important,12-20-2024
EMAIL Subordinate,How do I handle this?,12-25-2024
EMAIL ImportantPerson,Health Insurance Enrollment,12-31-2024
EMAIL Boss,Never Mind,01-03-2025
COUNT
NEXT
READ
NEXT
READ
COUNT

Your program should display this:

There are 6 emails to read.
Next email:
Sender: Boss
Subject: Never Mind
Date: 01-03-2025
Next email:
Sender: Boss
Subject: Important
Date: 12-20-2024
There are 4 emails to read.

## Input clarification


The program's expected input is a text file containing one command per line,
such as:

```
EMAIL Peer,Can you help me on this?,12-01-2024
EMAIL Boss,Important,12-20-2024
COUNT
NEXT
READ
```

The program must accept that file in either of two ways:

- If a filename is given as the first command-line argument, read the commands
  from that file: `./program testfile.txt`
- If no argument is given, read the commands from standard input:
  `./program < testfile.txt`

All output goes to standard output. The program exits with status 0 when it
completes normally.
